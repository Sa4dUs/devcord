 * This file defines application-level secrets or endpoints.
 *
 * Important:
 * - Do not commit real production secrets to version control.
 * - This file is intended for development or as a placeholder.
 * - For production, use secure environment handling methods
 *   such as environment variables or secret managers.
 *
 * Usage:
 * Replace placeholder values with actual ones during deployment.
 * Consider using Angular's environment-specific files to manage
 * configurations for different build targets.
